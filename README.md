# Arduino-8-Relay-Output-Timed-State-Control-Module
This module was made to run 8 activators in a specified time sequence that was set before with the keypad available in the module.

To specify the duration of activation from each activator, you should register the time (in seconds) with the keypad and LCD display.
The sequence will run indefinitely until you terminate the power source or decided to change the sequence.

This project was made with TinkerCAD in this following link:
